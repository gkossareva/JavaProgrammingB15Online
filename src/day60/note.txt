How do you create your own unchecked exception type :

       BreakTimeException , BrainOutOfMemoryException

      What is unchecked exception > Anything IS-A RunTimeException

      so ALL YOU NEED IS TO CREATE A SUBCLASS OF RunTimeException WITH YOUR OWN NAME


      public class BreakTimeException extends RuntimeException(or any sub class of it) {


      }


How do you create your own checked exception type :

    ALL YOU NEED IS TO CREATE A SUBCLASS OF ANY CHECKED EXCEPTION WITH YOUR OWN NAME


    public class HittingHeadToWallException extends Exception (or any sub class of it) {


    }


// This is how we can create our own checked exception
public class MyOwnCheckedExeption extends Exception{


}
// This is how we can create our own unchecked exception
public class BreakTimeException extends RuntimeException{

}

You can treated just like any other exception type Java already provided
